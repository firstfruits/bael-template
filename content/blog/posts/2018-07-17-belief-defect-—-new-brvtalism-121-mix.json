For surely\n\nEverything depends upon\n\nMy mood swing – now & the future!\n\n---\n\nFound poem written on a showery Sunday, 10 May 2009 no glues as to why I wrote it. \n\nA revisit to edit for posting to website – on this wet, windy Monday 3 August 2015\n\n© stephen c douglas May 10th 2009 Lower Hutt, New Zealand"
