  "body": "HOPE\n\n1st Sunday Advent\n\nBy Stephen Douglas\n\nAs our body requires oxygen to move, to breathe, to know the taste of life\n\nSo too our soul needs HOPE to press on where there is no light, no touch-stone\n\nHOPE for we mortals is the essences of being; when hope is crushed, removed\n\nWe are a skeleton, no flesh, no strength to move us on.\n\nHOPE is like the sun is to the day, light for us to play; the well spring of Wisdom to be living NOW, the awaited dream of expectation, aspiring us to be real.\n\nHOPE in the waiting is like the wings of the dove, lifting us high above the daily commotion (routine) on the current of faith and prayer, aspiring us to new elevations.\n\nHOPE is the light we use to shine upon the path of life, as well as the light to reflect who we are; in spirit and truth as we embody the deeds of hospitality, kindness, peace.\n\nHOPE can be the transfiguration of old to new; no longer bogged down by “what if” but rather the uplifting surge of anticipation that calms and wills our soul to hang in.\n\nHOPE is not ours to own but we need to prepare, be ready to wait, for we do not know exactly when hope will push us out to the deep, to believe Jesus is capable, capable of working his personification through our words and deeds\n\nFor the purpose of His kingdom come; His will be done; as much as you have done to these little ones, you have done it as unto Me; the Shepherd of Souls*, (be they new or old).  As we open up our present moment for our soul to breathe, the remarkable power of HOPE!\n\n\\*acknowledgement All Souls’ Day, 2nd November.

A new beginning when all seems\n\nLost on a hill not far away, \"Father I commit these to you for your keeping\"\n\nYou are not alone, I breathe my Spirit into your soul, don't be afraid for I have\n\nOvercome the world of pain and loss; my PEACE is what I leave with you\n\nBe restored, be made whole; transformed by the message, ready for a.....\n\nNew beginning. . . . .\n\n\\*In peace will I lie down, for it is You, O Lord,\n\nYou alone who makes me to rest secure.\n\nBe it on Your own beloved arm,\n\nO God of grace that I in peace shall awake.\n\nBe the peace of the Spirit mine this night (and day)\n\nBe the peace of the Son mine this night (and day)\n\nBe the peace of the Father mine this night (and day)\n\nThe peace of all peace be mine this night (and day)\n\nIn the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, Amen.\n\n---\n\nInspiration: sermon by Glenys Palmer *words taken from Aidan compline; bracketed   (and day)   my addition\n\n© stephen c douglas, 11 December 2017\n\nJOY\n\n3rd Sunday of Advent\n\n“Gaudete in Domino semper”\n\nBy Stephen Douglas\n\nIt's been said: JOY is Jesus, Others, Yourself; that's the theme\n\nWhich came to me, on this the third advent Sunday.\n\nLoving God, we open ourselves to you, trusting that this is how\n\nYou made us: you created us for JOY-filled (not full) lives.\n\nJOY - What does it mean is the asked question?  As the children's\n\nStory is told - Kind Oxen saying, Come in, (lonely, lost, least) there’s\n\nAlways room for a little one.  The last to come in was tired donkey\n\nCarrying Mary with child and Joseph aside; and Oxen chimes\n\nCome in, there's always room for one more to share our straw\n\nSo, Jesus was born amongst JOY-filled animals in a manger.\n\nActivity is our mantra: we be busy with 'this 'n' that' especially\n\nNow at Christmas; bustling 'here 'n' there' to purchase gifts\n\nTo sit around our tree, but where be the gift of JOY?\n\nIn the mist of everything going on JOY can be the candle bright\n\nWhich we light, as we offer others the warmth of place and heart.\n\nAs the hymnist penned the chorus, *\"O come into my heart\n\nLord Jesus, there is room in my (life) heart for you\".  Let it be with\n\nJOY (Jesus, Others, Yourself); pause, draw aside, to lay\n\nYour gifts and treasures at your Lord and Saviour's side.\n\nJOY is found when like Kind Oxen\n\nWe find and carry out our mission in life\n\nSo today we open ourselves to J-O-Y\n\nTrusting that God has already planted it in us;\n\nAll we need to do is give it care and offer it to share!\n\n“Rejoice in the Lord always”\n\n---\n\n*Hymn 206; There Is Room in My Heart for Thee | Emily E.

It takes all the\n\nCourage to embrace the new\n\nGrowth is always in the realm of change\n\nGrowth is the promise of “fruit to come”\n\nThough pain and heartache surround choice\n\nThe need to be brave, is bold\n\nWe need to make comfort a sacrifice – be\n\nAttentive to decline – because\n\nHumans like to stay the same, but we can’t\n\nStop life around us changing\n\nAs in nature – if a plant doesn’t grow\n\nUnfortunately it is dying.\n\nWhen we refuse to mature we get into\n\nA tangle of emotive chaos\n\nBehaviours which distract rather than bless;\n\nDelay is a great tactic used by\n\nThe enemy of one’s soul – though it need\n\nNot be so; failure is feedback\n\nIt means your alive – growing, with a\n\nPromise of fruit to come!!\n\nInspired by Business Edge Monday Morning Memo\n\n13 Feb 2017 © stephen c douglas 30 Dec.2017"
